If you're interested in the <b/>programmer</b> part, I started programming when I was about 10 or 11 in Python, then learned functionnal C, then C++, then came Java, then tidbits of assembly, and then maths, and then Scheme, then more x86, then I started being able to make contact with programming languages really fast, then maths again. Yes, I recently realized how importants maths can be for a programmer. If not just the logic that can come with a mature mind, the thought process can sometimes be helpful. Oh, and emacs.</p><p>If you're interested in the <b/>human</b> part (did I just imply programmers aren't humans?) I like playing and hearing music. I recently had a coup de coeur on two Qu√©becois groups that I find simply amazing called Maneige and Sloche. I also like biking and hiking.</p><p>Now if you're interested conversion with any of these parts of me, you can join me on <b/><i/>gmail</i></b>, my username is <b/><i/>bengioe</i></b>. (No hatemail please! I'm a kind and loving human! I swear I'm human!)
