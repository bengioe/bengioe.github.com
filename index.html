      ==Hi!==
      I'm Emmanuel Bengio. I'm a programmer, student, and part-time guitarist. 
      I am interested in a wide variety of subjects, but most particularly at this time, Machine Learning. 

      As a programmer I love to hack around and try new stuff which I often do not fully understand or grasp.
      I usually do not try to reivent the wheel, but it happens from time to time.
      Take a look at this page's source if you're curious (it ain't much).

      ==Projects==
      On my own time I work on tons of small or bigger projects, playing with Python or Assembly, making games or making my own *esoteric* languages.
      More on the {#projects projects} page!

    <div id="projects" class="bodypart">
      I'll try to keep this page ordered chronologically; if that's possible, me working on so many things at the same time.

      ==Pirate Story Online==

      My first *real* big project was of course, a game. 
      In itself, the game rules and dynamics were never clearly written down, nor were the amateur artists of great assistance. 
      Nevertheless, we were a fun gang, and being the only programmer among it, I wish I'd saved more funny quotes.
      

      At it's *apogee*, the game was online with chat, melee combat against monsters(if you can call them that), moving around and having a nice chat with NPCs, and, last but not least, the possibility to have negative HP. There were also some tools like a rudimentary map and sprite editor.

      
      The whole thing was written in a mix of Python, C++ with SFML, and alot of comments along the lines of <code>//This shouldn't work but it does</code>. You know, the usual when you're young and budding.
      

      You might enjoy watching [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10qhG1-BYLA a video] of the early stages of the game.
      ==PyVariable==
      I don't like *boost* so much as a C++ tool. It's handy of course, but it can easily become a mess when you don't know how to use it properly.

      In the spirit of reinventing the wheel, and also discovering more about my favorite language, Python, I decided to make a C++ class which would wrap a PyObject and overload as much operators as decently possible to make the handling of Python objects in C++ easy.

      It kinda works. You can take a look for yourself on the [http://github.com/bengioe/PyVariable git repo].

    <div id="thoughts" class="bodypart">
      Sometimes I think I'm a socialist. But then maybe I'm just a humanist. But then the two aren't really related. Are they? And what's anarcho-communism, can someone explain that?

      We all have minds with plenty of imagination and wishes and songs and unicorns. Sometimes it feels good to share, even with just ourselves.
    </div>
    <div id="aboutme" class="bodypart">
      By now, if you're smart enough you should know my name. Even though I still often feel like a little kid, I guess it's time to admit a dark and terrible fact. A square is not an ellipsoid.

      If you're interested in the _programmer_ part, I started programming when I was about 10 or 11 in Python, then learned functionnal C, then C++, then came Java, then tidbits of assembly, and then maths. Yes, I recently realized how importants maths can be for a programmer. If not just the logic, it's the whole application part as much as the thought process. Oh, and emacs.

      If you're interested in the _human_ part(did I just induce programmers aren't humans?) I like playing and hearing music. I couldn't really pinpoint a group or a genre that I like, because that wouldn't really be a reasonable depiction of my tastes, but let's say Led Zeppelin+acoustic guitar+progressive music+other stuff, where other stuff is... a vast array of things. I also like biking and hiking. I also enjoy thinking about life, the universe, and everything else; and when 42 doesn't pop up, I usually start wondering if we wouldn't be better off breeding pink unicorns rather than attempting to solve the universe while having children and being so evil to ourselves. In other words, I hope I'm not a nihilist.

      Now if you're interested in the last part of me, we should talk privately about it. You can join me on _*gmail*_, my username is _*bengioe*_. (No hatemail please! I'm a kind and loving human! I swear I'm human!)
