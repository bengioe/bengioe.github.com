<h3>Hi!</h3><p>
I'm Emmanuel Bengio. I'm a programmer, student, and sometimes guitarist, writer or cook. 
I am interested in a wide variety of subjects, but most particularly at this time, Machine Learning and Compilation. </p><p>As many, I love to hack around and try new stuff which I often do not fully understand or grasp.
I usually do not try to reivent the wheel, but it happens from time to time.
(Take a look at this page's source if you're curious (it ain't much))</p><p><h3>Projects</h3><p>
On my free time I work on tons of small or bigger projects, playing with Python or Assembly, making games or making my own <i/>esoteric</i> languages.
More on the {#projects projects} page!</p><p><h3>Thoughts</h3><p>
A kind of blog - I maintain thoughts and various ramblings on {#thoughts this} page.
