      ==Hi!==
      I'm Emmanuel Bengio. I'm a programmer, student, and sometimes guitarist, writer or cook. 
      I am interested in a wide variety of subjects, but most particularly at this time, Machine Learning and Compilation. 

      As many, I love to hack around and try new stuff which I often do not fully understand or grasp.
      I usually do not try to reivent the wheel, but it happens from time to time.
      (Take a look at this page's source if you're curious (it ain't much))

      ==Projects==
      On my free time I work on tons of small or bigger projects, playing with Python or Assembly, making games or making my own *esoteric* languages.
      More on the {#projects projects} page!

      ==Thoughts==
      A kind of blog - I maintain thoughts and various ramblings on {#thoughts this} page.
    </div>
    <div id="projects" class="bodypart">
      I'll try to keep this page ordered chronologically; newer projects are on top.
      ==Rogue==
      Rogue is a Scheme-to-x64 compiler written (almost) entirely in Scheme by me and a friend for my compilation class. It uses a limited, but usable, subset of Scheme. It is indeed usable enough that Rogue can compile itself. Only once though, because it lacks a fully-functionnal <code>eval</code> function and because it would take a formidable amout of time, Rogue having little to no optimizations.

      It was written and "bootstrapped" using [http://dynamo.iro.umontreal.ca/wiki/index.php/Main_Page Gambit Scheme].
      ==Voxaedra==
      For some time I've fancied doing another game after my youth adventure with PSO (see below). I've been working for a while on a 3D voxel-based game, which I do not know which gameplay direction it could take.

      More on that later!

      ==PyVariable==
      I don't like *boost* so much as a C++ tool. It's handy of course, but it can easily become a mess when you don't know how to use it properly.

      In the spirit of reinventing the wheel, and also discovering more about my favorite language, Python, I decided to make a C++ class which would wrap a PyObject and overload as much operators as decently possible to make the handling of Python objects in C++ easy.

      It kinda works. You can take a look for yourself on the [http://github.com/bengioe/PyVariable git repo].

      ==Pirate Story Online==

      My first *real* big project was of course, a game. 
      In itself, the game rules and dynamics were never clearly written down, nor were the amateur artists of great assistance. 
      Nevertheless, we were a fun gang, and being the only programmer among it, I wish I'd saved more funny quotes.
      

      At it's *apogee*, the game was online with chat, melee combat against monsters(if you can call them that), moving around and having a nice chat with NPCs, and, last but not least, the possibility to have negative HP. There were also some tools like a rudimentary map and sprite editor.

      
      The whole thing was written in a mix of Python, C++ with SFML, and alot of comments along the lines of <code>//This shouldn't work but it does</code>. You know, the usual when you're young and budding.
      

      You might enjoy watching [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10qhG1-BYLA a video] of the early stages of the game.

      Here is a list of things I wrote. Hopefully you will find inspiring words among the ramblings of a young person.

        {#thought-unicorns-and-epsilons Unicorns and Epsilons}<br/>

    <div id="aboutme" class="bodypart">
      If you're interested in the _programmer_ part, I started programming when I was about 10 or 11 in Python, then learned functionnal C, then C++, then came Java, then tidbits of assembly, and then maths, and then Scheme, then more x86, then I started being able to make contact with programming languages really fast, then maths again. Yes, I recently realized how importants maths can be for a programmer. If not just the logic that can come with a mature mind, the thought process can sometimes be helpful. Oh, and emacs.

      If you're interested in the _human_ part (did I just imply programmers aren't humans?) I like playing and hearing music. I recently had a coup de coeur on two Qu√©becois groups that I find simply amazing called Maneige and Sloche. I also like biking and hiking.

      Now if you're interested conversion with any of these parts of me, you can join me on _*gmail*_, my username is _*bengioe*_. (No hatemail please! I'm a kind and loving human! I swear I'm human!)
