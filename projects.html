I'll try to keep this page ordered chronologically; newer projects are on top.
<h3>Rogue</h3><p>
Rogue is a Scheme-to-x64 compiler written (almost) entirely in Scheme by me and a friend for my compilation class. It uses a limited, but usable, subset of Scheme. It is indeed usable enough that Rogue can compile itself. Only once though, because it lacks a fully-functionnal <code>eval</code> function and because it would take a formidable amout of time, Rogue having little to no optimizations.</p><p>It was written and "bootstrapped" using <a href=http://dynamo.iro.umontreal.ca/wiki/index.php/Main_Page> Gambit Scheme</a>.
<h3>Voxaedra</h3><p>
For some time I've fancied doing another game after my youth adventure with PSO (see below). I've been working for a while on a 3D voxel-based game, which I do not know which gameplay direction it could take.</p><p>More on that later!</p><p><h3>PyVariable</h3><p>
I don't like <i/>boost</i> so much as a C++ tool. It's handy of course, but it can easily become a mess when you don't know how to use it properly.</p><p>In the spirit of reinventing the wheel, and also discovering more about my favorite language, Python, I decided to make a C++ class which would wrap a PyObject and overload as much operators as decently possible to make the handling of Python objects in C++ easy.</p><p>It kinda works. You can take a look for yourself on the <a href=http://github.com/bengioe/PyVariable> git repo</a>.</p><p><h3>Pirate Story Online</h3><p></p><p>My first <i/>real</i> big project was of course, a game. 
In itself, the game rules and dynamics were never clearly written down, nor were the amateur artists of great assistance. 
Nevertheless, we were a fun gang, and being the only programmer among it, I wish I'd saved more funny quotes.</p><p>
At it's <i/>apogee</i>, the game was online with chat, melee combat against monsters(if you can call them that), moving around and having a nice chat with NPCs, and, last but not least, the possibility to have negative HP. There were also some tools like a rudimentary map and sprite editor.</p><p>
The whole thing was written in a mix of Python, C++ with SFML, and alot of comments along the lines of <code>//This shouldn't work but it does</code>. You know, the usual when you're young and budding.</p><p>
You might enjoy watching <a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10qhG1-BYLA> a video</a> of the early stages of the game.
