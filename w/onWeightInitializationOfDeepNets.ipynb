      "### On weight initialization of deep nets\n",
      "I will illustrate here the computations made in Glorot et al.(2010) and He et al.(2015), hopefully in a clear and simple way. Any suggestions and additonal references are welcome!\n",
      "\n",
      "I will try to use simple and detailed math. Again suggestions and clarifications are welcome. All integrals are done in Wolfram Alpha, as I am skeptical of my own integration skills, and would not want to claim falsehoods.\n",

      "\n",
      "- We need to assume $X\\sim D$ and each dimension $X_i$ as i.i.d., with some known mean and variance $\\mu_X$ and $\\sigma^2_X$,\n",
      "- $W_{l,ij} \\sim \\mathcal{W}_l$ is the sampled weight at layer $l$,\n",
      "- $\\mathbb{E}[\\mathcal{W}] = 0$ will simplify computations,\n",
      "- $U_{l,i}$ is the pre-activation value of unit $i$ in layer $l$,\n",
      "- $H_{l,i}$ is the post-activation value of the same unit,\n",
      "- for simplicity of notation we assume there are $n$ inputs, $n$ hidden units per layer.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the i.i.d. assumption on $X$ is possibly strong, an identical mean and variance across some normalized $X_i$s is sufficient under most cases.\n",

      "#### Fully connected nets\n",
      "\n",
      "We will analyse fully-connected neural nets, but this results holds for convolutional networks and to an extent recurrent networks, without many modifications to the analysis. Consider the value of $H_{l,i}$: \n",
